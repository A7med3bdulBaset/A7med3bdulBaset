# 2023 Wrap up

written on 28 Dec 2023

Here we are saying Goodbye to 2023 and Welcome to 2024. It was a great year for me. My first year being a real developer.

My first knowledge about programming was in about 2017 at the first year of my secondary school. We used to have a subject called Computer (as abbrevation of Computer Science). To be hones it was very bad experience. We were learning Visual Basic and it was very boring. We had no idea about what we were doing. We were just copying codes from the book and pasting them in the Visual Basic IDE. We didn't know what the VB is, what does this code do, or even what we are doing. My teacher was just hosting his PC screen on the projector, copying the code from the book, we were copying the code from the projector, and pasting it in the IDE.

The second year of my secondary school was a little better. We were learning PHP. Again some advanced lessons about PHP, Database, etc. without having an idea about the basics of programming. We had some lessons about HTML such as `<input />`, `<button>` and `<marquee>` (How coll is the `<marquee>`' days?). I found the HTML very interesting and an easy starting point to start with. and it started from there.

These days 2019-2021 I've learnt HTML, CSS and some JS basics and built some basic HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript stuff. In 2022 I started learning React, then FireBase => TailwindCSS => TypeScript => Express.js => MongoDB and some other stuff in the way. Until May 2023.

In May 2023 I knew about Next.js My Life Changer. Next made me fall in love with coding but not the arbitrary way I was on. In fact it organized my path. It was my window to the open-source community that made me too much better.

Since May 2023 to today 27 Dec 2023 I've made: (According to #GithubUnwrapped)

-  **5536** contributions on Github.
-  23K LOF (Lines Of Code) additions and 7K LOF deletions. %95+ of them are TypeScript.
-  238 Merged Pull Requests.
-  Created 45 repositories.
-  Published my first [npm package](https://github.com/AhmedBaset/eslint-plugin-rtl-friendly)
-  34 Github issues, 21 of them are closed.
-  99 stars.

## Open Source Contributions

I've contributed to many open source projects (some of them are very simple such as correction docs typo, etc.):

## Repositories

Here are some open source repositories I've created this year:

## Work

- July - Sep: I worked a freelancer on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~014c62e51cf0b7e1cf) and built 4 cool projects. I'm taking some time off to study for my final college exams.
- Sep - Now: Part-time Frontend Developer.

That's it. I'm very proud of what I have done and very excited for what I'm going to do in 2024.
